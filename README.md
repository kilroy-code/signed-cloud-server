# Signed Cloud Server

Basic cloud storage in which contents are cryptographically signed, using distributed-storage as a co-dependency.

Suitable as a back-end for [ki1r0y](https://github.com/kilroy-code/ki1r0y) [distributed-security](https://github.com/kilroy-code/distributed-security).

To run stand-alone:

```
npm install
npm run start # or npm run background
```

To include in another express-like server, see [app.mjs](./app.mjs).
